Hi, I’m @Killaship! I like rock music, programming, and electronics!
I'm pretty interested in how computers work, so I've taken up working on a hobby operating system, and I've been trying to make a CPU in a digital logic simulator!
If you'd like to see more about what simulator I use, I have a page on my website just for that, right [here!](https://killaship.github.io/opinions/sebastiansim.html)

Finally, if you didn't click on that link, I have a website, with pages containing all sorts of things! (about me, project details, a W.I.P. browser game, etc.)
